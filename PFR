PETITION FOR REVIEW

Christopher J. Tossing, Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner, hereby petitions the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 808.10 and Wis. Stat. § (Rule) 809.62, to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, District IV, in In re the Marriage of Sarah M. Morgan v. Christopher J. Tossing, Appeal No. 2023AP2203, filed on July 10, 2025 (unpublished per curiam), affirming the Dane County Circuit Court’s denial of Mr. Tossing’s motion to modify child support.
ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW
Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by not adequately considering Christopher Tossing’s significant income reduction during his ten-year incarceration and the likely continued inability to earn his previous income upon release.
The Court of Appeals decided the issue as follows: The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the circuit court considered the relevant factors and acted within its discretion in assigning greater weight to the nature of Mr. Tossing’s criminal conduct and the children’s needs, and rejecting arguments that the court failed to account for employability, projected arrears, and ability-to-pay constraints. (COA decision filed July 10, 2025; reconsideration denied Aug. 7, 2025 (P-App. __).)
BRIEF STATEMENT OF CRITERIA FOR REVIEW
1. Rule 809.62(1r)(c) & (d): Review will develop and harmonize the law by clarifying how Rottscheit’s factors apply when incarceration is long enough to eliminate present ability to pay, and whether a limiting principle is required to prevent per se denials masked as discretion. Resolution will must guide uniform statewide practice.
#GT100[P6 CCS]-2/many-TEXT Version of Body of - #GP220[P6 CCS]-1/2-D#1e
2. Rule 809.62(1r)(e): Due to changing circumstances—including Artificial intelligence’s impact on mid-career software roles and supervision-related digital restrictions—employability analyses are ripe for re-examination under Rottscheit. Resolution will must guide courts on required findings for post-release earning capacity.

3. Rule 809.62(1r)(a) & (b): The case presents a constitutional backdrop (due process/equal protection) and a need for policy guidance to ensure orders during long incarceration reflect actual ability to pay rather than punitive effects. Resolution will must guide lower courts regarding ability-to-pay-grounded orders.
STATEMENT OF FACTS AND OF THE CASE
Nature and posture. This is a post-divorce child-support modification motion based on incarceration. The circuit court denied modification in 2023. The Court of Appeals (District IV) affirmed on July 10, 2025 (unpublished per curiam). Mr. Tossing’s motion for reconsideration was denied on August 7, 2025. (P-App. __, __.)
Background summarized in the COA opinion. The parties married in 2008, have two children, and divorced in 2017. At divorce, Mr. Tossing worked as a software engineer and was ordered to pay $2,430 per month. In 2022, he pled no contest to Child Enticement—Sexual Contact, received a sentence of ten years and two months of initial confinement and seven years and ten months of extended supervision, and moved to modify support due to incarceration. The circuit court denied the motion, relying on Rottscheit. (P-App. ; R..)

ARGUMENT
Introductory statement. This Petition asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide whether Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62, has been misapplied to allow trial courts to deny all relief during a decade-long incarceration—leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in uncollectable child-support arrears. The Court of Appeals affirmed such a denial here in a way that both conflicts with Rottscheit and leaves Wisconsin law unsettled in a modern era of long prison sentences, technological obsolescence, felony stigma, and permanent employment barriers.
Why this case is an ideal vehicle. The record cleanly presents both (a) a misapplication of controlling precedent and (b) novel, recurring policy issues of statewide importance. The decision below not only distorts Rottscheit’s holistic balancing test, but it also raises serious fairness concerns—even implicating due process and equal protection principles—given the extreme, unpayable debt created by leaving an order untouched through lengthy incarceration. Supreme Court guidance is needed to harmonize the law, ensure child support remains rooted in reality, and prevent outcomes that undermine both payment incentives and children’s best interests.
#GT100[P6 CCS]-4/many-TEXT Version of Body of - #GP220[P6 CCS]-1/2-D#1e
A. Rottscheit misapplied: “nature of the offense” used as a dispositive bar.
Doctrine. Rottscheit holds child support is not punishment (¶33) and requires courts to weigh all relevant circumstances (¶¶41–42), including: length of incarceration; the nature of the offense/course of conduct; assets; employability and likelihood of future income upon release; work-release opportunities; the arrearages that will accumulate; and the children’s needs. “Nature of the offense” is relevant insofar as a course of conduct shows disregard for support duties; it is not a moral-culpability trump. See also LeMere, ¶13; Rohde-Giovanni, ¶18 (valid discretion requires the correct legal standard and an articulated, reasoned process).
Application. The circuit court elevated “nature of the offense” to decisive status while denying relief despite decade-long confinement and de minimis income, without reasoned findings on employability or the arrearage trajectory. (R.; P-App..) The Court of Appeals affirmed by deference, effectively permitting a per se bar under the guise of “weighting.” This conflicts with Rottscheit’s holistic framework.
Statewide importance (Rule 809.62(1r)(c), (d)). Without a clear statement that “nature of offense” cannot eclipse ability-to-pay analysis, outcomes will vary county-to-county, undermining uniform administration of support law.
Constitutional backdrop. Bearden, 461 U.S. at 666–68, 672–73; Turner, 564 U.S. at 447–48 (process must account for ability to pay in civil enforcement contexts).
#GT100[P6 CCS]-5/many-TEXT Version of Body of - #GP220[P6 CCS]-1/2-D#1e
B. Limiting principle for long-incarceration cases (implement Rottscheit ¶46 n.12).
Doctrine. Rottscheit explicitly recognized that “ten, or even five, years” of incarceration may “tip the balance,” and that refusal to modify in such circumstances “may well” be an erroneous exercise of discretion. 2003 WI 62, ¶46 n.12. The factors at ¶¶41–42 demand reasoned findings; LeMere, ¶13; Rohde-Giovanni, ¶18.
Guardrail requested. When (1) incarceration is ≥ five years; (2) present ability to pay is de minimis and there are no non-exempt assets; and (3) Wis. Stat. § 767.59(1m)’s prospective-only rule will lock in large arrears, denial of modification should be presumptively unreasonable absent specific, on-the-record findings explaining why a guideline, ability-to-pay order (e.g., DCF minimum-wage baseline) would harm the children. See Wis. Admin. Code § DCF 150.03(1), (3).
Statewide importance. A rebuttable presumption (or required findings) operationalizes Rottscheit n.12 and harmonizes practice while preserving discretion to rebut based on particular facts. Rule 809.62(1r)(c), (d).
#GT100[P6 CCS]-6/many-TEXT Version of Body of - #GP220[P6 CCS]-1/2-D#1e
C. “Needs of the children” when arrears will be uncollectible.
Doctrine. Rottscheit warns that allowing arrears to “accumulate endlessly” discourages payment (¶36). In long-incarceration cases where collections are negligible and debt will balloon, the “needs of the children” factor can favor a realistic, ability-to-pay order that sustains future compliance, not an illusory amount that generates only debt. See ¶¶41–42.
Application. Maintaining a pre-incarceration order through a decade of zero earning capacity creates uncollectable arrears and depresses compliance—outcomes Rottscheit counsels against. (R.; P-App..)
Statewide importance. Clarifying the proper placement of this factor avoids punitive-in-effect orders that yield debt rather than support. Rule 809.62(1r)(c), (d).
D. Abuse of discretion: no findings on employability/future income and projected arrears.
Doctrine. Discretion is valid only if the court (1) examines the relevant facts, (2) applies the correct legal standards, and (3) uses a rational process. LeMere, ¶13; Rohde-Giovanni, ¶18. Rottscheit requires specific consideration of “the payer’s employability and likelihood of future income upon release” and “the amount of arrearages that will accumulate during the incarceration.” ¶41. When deviating from guideline baselines, courts must state reasons. Wis. Stat. § 767.511(1m)–(1n); Luciani, 199 Wis. 2d at 294–96.
Application (including reconsideration). The record reflects no on-the-record findings on employability/future income—including industry obsolescence, legal/digital supervision limits, and age-related decline—or on the arrearage model; yet the court left the $2,430/month order intact. (R.; P-App. (Mot. for Recons. ¶¶__; COA denial Aug. 7, 2025).) That is factor-recital, not reasoned balancing.
#GT100[P6 CCS]-7/many-TEXT Version of Body of - #GP220[P6 CCS]-1/2-D#1e
Statewide importance. Requiring explicit findings on employability and projected arrears will standardize trial practice and appellate review. Rule 809.62(1r)(c), (d).
E. Federal IV-D compliance: incarceration may not be treated as voluntary unemployment.
Doctrine. Federal law requires state guidelines to reflect actual ability to pay and forbids treating incarceration as voluntary unemployment for establishing or modifying support. 45 C.F.R. § 302.56(c)(3); see § 302.56(c)(1)–(4). States must allow review/adjustment when a parent has been incarcerated more than 180 days and may not exclude incarceration from consideration. 45 C.F.R. § 303.8(b)(7)(ii), (c).
Application. Denial here, grounded in intentionality and offense “nature,” functions like imputing pre-incarceration earnings and refusing adjustment—out of step with the IV-D framework. (R.; P-App..)
Statewide importance. Harmonizing Rottscheit-based discretion with IV-D requirements will provide needed guidance to courts and agencies. Rule 809.62(1r)(b), (c), (d).
F. Ripe for re-examination: Artificial intelligence and modern post-release constraints.
Doctrine. Even where decisions accord with precedent, review is warranted when changed conditions make those precedents ripe for re-examination. Rule 809.62(1r)(e).
Changed conditions. Artificial intelligence is rapidly automating substantial portions of software development, compressing demand for mid-career roles; sex-offense supervision commonly imposes computer/Internet restrictions; and age-related decline further limits reentry earnings. These realities materially alter employability—precisely the Rottscheit factor courts must assess—and were flagged in reconsideration as missing findings. (P-App.__ (Mot. for Recons. ¶¶__).)
#GT100[P6 CCS]-8/8 FINAL-TEXT Version of Body of - #GP220[P6 CCS]-1/2-D#1e
Relief. The Court should instruct that, with long incarceration, trial courts must make explicit findings on post-release employability that address technological obsolescence and supervision constraints before denying modification.
Statewide importance. These constraints recur and have broad labor-market impact. Rule 809.62(1r)(c)–(e).CONCLUSION
The petition presents misapplication of Rottscheit, the need for a long-incarceration guardrail (¶46 n.12), correction of the “needs of the children” analysis where arrears will be uncollectible, required findings on employability and arrearages, IV-D compliance, and re-examination in light of Artificial intelligence and modern supervision constraints.
Relief requested. Grant review; reverse; and remand with instructions to (a) enter a guideline, ability-to-pay order for the incarceration period (e.g., the minimum-wage baseline under Wis. Admin. Code § DCF 150.03(1), (3)), or (b) alternatively, make specific on-the-record findings under Rottscheit ¶¶41–42 and Wis. Stat. §§ 767.511(1m)–(1n) explaining any departure, in light of Wis. Stat. § 767.59(1m) (prospective-only).
